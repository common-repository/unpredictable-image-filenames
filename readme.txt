Images uploaded from cameras can have predictable (and guessable) filenames. Prevent predictable filenames. Use Unpreditable Image Filenames.

== Description ==

Most cameras and smartphones number their images in a predictable format. For example, iPhones use the format `IMG_0001.jpg`, `IMG_0002.jpg`, etc. If you upload `IMG_0345.jpg` to a post and publish it and then upload `IMG_0346.jpg` to a post that you are not yet ready to publish, someone could guess the URL of `IMG_0346.jpg` and see it before you're ready.

The Unpredictable Image Filenames plugin renames image files when you upload them to a sufficiently unguessable name. For example, `IMG_0345.jpg` could be renamed `334AB1E8-28AB-4BE1-882D-3C112E95F055.jpg`, and `IMG_0346.jpg` could be renamed `A67C9CF9-0BB5-4FB4-AD03-DCB294F853EC.jpg`. Try and guess that!
